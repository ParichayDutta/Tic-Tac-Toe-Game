# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a simple command-line-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python. Two players take turns to play the game by selecting a number between 1-9 to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the board. The game continues until a player wins or there is a draw.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players alternate turns as 'X' and 'O'.
- **Win condition check**: The game checks for winning conditions after every move.
- **Draw detection**: If the board is full and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
- **Command-line interface**: Easy-to-use text interface for playing.
